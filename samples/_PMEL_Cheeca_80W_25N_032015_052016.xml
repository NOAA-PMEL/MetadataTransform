Disclaimer: The oxygen measurement is made in the equilibrated air. We have found that the oxygen does not come to complete equilibrium so any rapid changes in oxygen do not get properly captured using this system. Therefore, we tend to use the oxygen data only as a qualitative sense of the biology.  It is not a quantitative measure.</Description_of_Variable>

					<CO2_Sensor_Calibration>At the beginning of each sample, the instrument self-calibrates using a zero and high standard. The zero standard is generated by cycling a small amount of air through a soda lime chamber. The high standard is from a cylinder of calibrated standard reference gas, 612.75 umol/mol, from ESRL. ESRL standards are traceable to WMO x93 scale with a stated reproducibility of 0.06 micromole/mole.

		<Additional_Information>
o All measurements are at sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure. 

o During the equilibration cycle, a closed loop of air equilibrates with seawater for 10 minutes. Once the equilibration period is complete, the pump stops and the system opens to the atmosphere allowing the pressure to equilibrate with atmospheric pressure. Measurements are recorded for 30 seconds at 2 hertz and then averaged.

o During the air cycle, fresh air is pumped through the detector for 1 minute. Once the pump stops, the system opens to the atmosphere allowing the pressure to equilibrate with atmospheric pressure. Measurements are recorded for 30 seconds at 2 hertz and then averaged.

o The gas streams for both the air cycle and equilibrator cycle are partially dried before entering the detector. The values listed as wet xCO2 generally have relative humidity levels ranging from 40 to 80 percent. The humidity levels increase over the course of a deployment.

o Sampling occurs every 3 hours. The infrared detector is calibrated at the beginning of every sampling period. Averaged data and standard deviations for each measurement are transmitted back daily.

o To calculate the dry measurements, the water mole fraction in the Licor detector must be known. A relative humidity sensor is located immediately downstream of the detector.

o As part of the QC process, each data set is compared with the Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) data from GlobalView-CO2.As part of the QC process, xCO2 air measurements are compared to the following data sets when available: previous MAPCO2 deployment if overlap on recovery/deployment, following MAPCO2 deployment if overlap on recovery/deployment, and Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) xCO2 air data from GlobalView-CO2. The available  comparison data sets are in good agreement with the MAPCO2 air data and no adjustment was made.

o During the QC process, an adjustment to the Licor pressure is also made based on each sensor&apos; s bias to barometric pressure as measured in the lab.  This system has Licor pressure bias of -0.200 applied.

Averaged wet xCO2 measurements are post-calibrated using a simple linear regression between original averaged measurements and span coefficients, a method similar to the post-cal established by the underway pCO2 community as described here: Feely, R.A., R. Wanninkhof, H.B. Milburn, C.E. Cosca, M. Stapp, and P.P. Murphy,  A new automated underway system for making high precision pCO2 measurements onboard research ships, Analytica Chim. Acta, 377, 185-191, 1998.
Post calculation correlation between Licor temperature and coefficient is: Licor coef = -0.001370 * Temp + 0.8970 r^2 = 0.97

o No data = -9.999 or -999
